    <h1>What am I doing now?</h1>
    <p>I live in London, and spend my time on the following (in decreasing order of time spent):</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Researching data ethics and policy at <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/centre-for-data-ethics-and-innovation">CDEI.</a></li>
        <li>Developing my knowledge and understanding of machine learning technologies, starting with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_Intelligence:_A_Modern_Approach">Russell and Norvig</a> and <a href="https://www.fast.ai">fast.ai</a>.</li>
        <li>Undergoing intensive physio regime to try to overcome <a href="https://www.physio-pedia.com/Iliotibial_Band_Syndrome">ITB Syndrome</a>.</li>
        <li>Whilst I can't do much cardio due to the above, I'm trying to build some muscle having recently acquired some dumbbells (a scarce commodity during lockdown).</li>
        <li>Watching interesting films, TV, and documentaries - these provide a welcome and entertaining relief during lockdown.</li>
        <li>Reading books, tracking progress with <a href="https://thestorygraph.com">The StoryGraph</a>.</li>
        <li>Learning to play the some songs I like on the piano.</li>
        <li>On pause until September: studying part-time for an MA in Digital Culture and Society at King's College London.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I'll endeavour to keep this page up to date as my activities change.</p>
