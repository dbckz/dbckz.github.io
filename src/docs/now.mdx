# What am I doing now?

I live in London, and spend my time on the following (in decreasing order of time spent):
    
* Researching data ethics and policy at CDEI.
* Developing my knowledge and understanding of machine learning technologies, starting with Russell and Norvig and fast.ai.
* Undergoing intensive physio regime to try to overcome ITB Syndrome.
* Whilst I can't do much cardio due to the above, I'm trying to build some muscle having recently acquired some dumbbells (a scarce commodity during lockdown).
* Watching interesting films, TV, and documentaries - these provide a welcome and entertaining relief during lockdown.
* Reading books, tracking progress [here][reading].
* Learning to play the some songs I like on the piano.
* On pause until September: studying part-time for an MA in Digital Culture and Society at King's College London.

I'll endeavour to keep this page up to date as my activities change.
