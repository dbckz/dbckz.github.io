[Here][youtube] is a YouTube channel I created c. 2008. It contains several delights:

* Guitar covers of songs by my favourite bands of the time
* My A Level Electronics project - a microprocessor programmed to play a (very grating) rendition of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
* A mini documentary entitled Our Day in Epworth, chronicling the highs and lows of a trip to the [Festival of the Plough][plough] in Epworth, North Lincolnshire

(Un)fortunately, this account is registered to an old email account I have long since lost access to. I have tried to wrestle back control from the powers at be, but to no avail. All I can do is accept that these creative pursuits of my former self will remain stored in a Google datacenter for millennia to come.
